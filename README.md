# Arduino Projects with Python Control

This repository contains Arduino projects that can be controlled using Python scripts. Currently, it includes the following project:

### <_> Project: [Control LEDs With Python](/Control-LEDs-With-Python)
Control LEDs connected to an Arduino board using Python scripts. Find the implementation in the [Control-LEDs-With-Python](/Control-LEDs-With-Python) directory.

### <_> Project: [Face Detection With Python](/Face-Detection)
Control the number of the active LEDs based on the number of detected faces. Find the implementation in the [Face-Detection](/Face-Detection) directory.

### How to Use

Each project directory contains detailed instructions on setting up Arduino hardware and running Python scripts. Ensure you have the necessary components and software installed before attempting to run the projects.

### Directory Structure

- `/Control-LEDs-With-Python`: Arduino sketch (`leds-py.ino`) and Python scripts (`main.py`) to control LEDs connected to the Arduino board.
- `/Face-Detection`: Arduino sketch (`leds-face-detection.ino`) and Python scripts (`face-detection.py`) to control LEDs based on detected faces.

### Requirements

- Arduino board and IDE
- Python >= 3.7

### Contributing

- Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or create pull requests.
